# Dotnet-CSharp-Client-SNowIntegration

The solution have two projects and these are very basic C# application, that communicate with SNow dev instance and the purpuse is to READ/WRITE data into the dev service now instance.
Docker support is optional that you can be added with Visual Studio.

I have created customers table in my personel SN dev instance, you can create basically any table and add some columns with datatypes. 
Create user and assign appropriate user role to the user.


1) SNow - Basic C# library
2) Temp Project - C# Web Form Generic template application
               - GetIncident.aspx -button click have code to communicate with ServiceNow.
